### Upgrade to Jest 26

With this version brings the use of Jest `24.9.0`. Major Jest changes in [Jest v26](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2600)

The main breaking feature is `resetMocks` is now set to `true` by default in the Jest config.

**Note:**

You will be required to upgrade to Jest 26 due to some incompatibilies with using mixed versions in BRS and your app, please ensure you upgrade your projects Jest version when you upgrade BRS.

If you encounter this error during build time then you will be required to make the move to Jest `26`.

```sh
There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.

The backpack-react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

  "babel-jest": "^26.6.0"
```

### Service works

BRS now uses the Workbox InjectManifest plugin over the GenerateSW plugin
